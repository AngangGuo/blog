## NDI
### Screen Capture HX vs Screen Capture
* Sreen Capture is uncompressed and requires a lot of bandwidth.
* Screen Capture HX allows for smoother video streaming and reduces the strain on your network, 
making it a good choice for situations with limited network resources or when streaming over wireless connections.

Here is the detailed information from official website:
> NDI Screen Capture HX provides features comparable to NDI Screen Capture, but it uniquely leverages GPU acceleration. 
>
> This ensures low-latency video delivery, supporting resolutions up to 4K and frame rates of 120 Hertz or higher, 
using H.264 or HEVC compression. 
GPU acceleration significantly reduces your system's CPU workload, enhancing overall efficiency.

[//]: # (### Screen Capture vs Screen Monitor)

### How to capture screen? {#capture}
From computer A run `Screen Capture` to share your computerâ€™s desktop video and/or audio to 
any other device on your network with NDI.

* `NDI Launcher` > `Screen Capture` 
* Right click `Screen Capture` icon in Windows taskbar
* `Capture Settings` > `Config Rol` > Resize and move the `NDI Region of Interest` window to your desired location
* Select `Region of interest` to enable screen capture

### How to show Zoom screen to ProPresenter?
* Capture the Zoom Application. See [How to capture screen?]({{< ref "#capture" >}})
* Config the captured Zoom screen as the input of ProPresenter. See [ProPresenter NDI Input]({{< ref "#ndi-input" >}})

### How to change computer name shown in NDI source?
`NDI Access Manager` > Advanced > NDI Device Alias > Set any name you like

## ProPresenter & NDI
### NDI Input {#ndi-input}
We can use NDI signal from other devices at the same network 
as ProPresenter input source and show them out to screen as video.

**NDI Video Input Configuration**
* ProPresenter > Preferences > Inputs
* Click `+` icon to add a new video input
  * `Name`: NDISignalFromPC1
  * `Device`: ASUS6216(VLC)
* Audio
  * `Source`: No Audio Source / Video (Embedded)

**Shown In ProPresenter**
* `Media` > `Video Input` > `+` Add Media > Select input device `NDISignalFromPC1`
* Click the video source to capture video 

Note:
* The video input behavior can be one of these: `Video Input`, `Backgroud` and `Foreground`
* The video input scaling can be one of these: `Scale to Fit`, `Scale to Fill`, and `Stretch to Fill`

### Output
You can also send ProPresenter screen out as NDI signal.

**Screen Configuration**
* `Screens` > `Config Screens...`
* `Audience` > Click `+` to add a new screen 
* `New NDI`
  * Output: asus6212 - NDI 1
  * Name: asus6212 - NDI 1 (You can rename it as anything you like)
  * Mode: 720p59.94 (You can select other mode)
  
From other computers in the same network you'll see this NDI video in NDI Screen Monitor or as another ProPresenter input source.
