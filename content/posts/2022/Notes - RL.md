### How to reset a stuck infuser for De'Longhi coffee machine?
If you can't insert(or remove) the infuser, you can reset it by following these steps:
* Install all the other accessories, especially the drip try and waste coffee container/tray
* Close the service door
* Unplug from the outlet
* Wait 3 seconds and then plug in again
* Wait for all the lights to go off
* Machine is reset and you can insert or remove the infuser now

NOTE: The first step is very important. If you forget to insert the waste coffee tray, the machine won't reset.
