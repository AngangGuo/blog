Sometimes the ProPresent shows the output on the main screen(computer) instead of projector.

We can fix this problem by making sure the display settings in Windows as well as the settings in ProPresenter are correct.

### From Windows
* Right-click the desktop and select `Display Settings`
* Identify the screen and rearrange the screen if needed
* Make sure the `Extend these displays` is selected in Multiple displays
* Click your main screen, and make sure the `Make this my main display` is marked

### Display Setting For ProPresenter 6
Go to ProPresenter > Preferences > Display tab

You should see several boxes in the middle of the screen. 
The box with the white bar across the top or bottom represents your main monitor.

We want to make sure that ProPresenter output is NOT set to our main monitor, 
so if the box with the white bar is filled with black and it says `Out` in it, 
simply drag it to the other side.

### Display Setting For ProPresenter 7
Go to ProPresenter 7 > Screens > Configure Screens... > Audience > 

* Select your Audience screen
* Select the correct monitor/projector from the `Output` dropdown list
* If you are not sure which name is for monitor or projector, 
clicking the `Identify` on the right side of the screen name, ProPresenter will show the name on the monitor 
* Close the `Screen Configuration` window
* Verify the output by clicking the `Audience` link at the top right of ProPresenter
