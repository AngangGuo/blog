## Fix ProPresenter Display Problem
Sometimes the ProPresenter shows the output on the main screen(computer) instead of projector.

We can fix this problem by making sure the display settings in Windows as well as the settings in ProPresenter are correct.

### Display Settings In Windows
* Right-click the desktop and select `Display Settings`
* Click `Identify` button to identify the ID of you main screen and the ID of your projector
* (Optional)Re-arrange the screen by drag and drop the box
* Make sure the `Extend these displays` is selected in Multiple displays
* Click your main screen, and make sure the `Make this my main display` is marked

### Display Settings In ProPresenter 6
Go to ProPresenter > Preferences > Display tab

You should see several boxes in the middle of the screen. 
The box with the white bar across the top or bottom represents your main monitor.

We want to make sure that ProPresenter output is NOT set to our main monitor. 
If the box filled with black and with `Out` in it becomes your main monitor(with the white bar on it), 
simply drag it to the side of your projector.

### Display Settings in ProPresenter 7
Go to ProPresenter 7 > Screens > Configure Screens... > Audience > 

* Select your Audience screen
* Select the correct monitor/projector from the `Output` dropdown list
* If you are not sure which name is for monitor or projector, 
clicking the `Identify` on the right side of the screen name, ProPresenter will show the name on the monitor 
* Close the `Screen Configuration` window
* Verify the output by clicking the `Audience` link at the top right of ProPresenter
