### How to reinstall macOS?

* Turn on your Mac and continue to press and hold the `power button` until you see the startup options window. 
* Click the gear icon labeled Options, then click Continue. 
* Connect to WiFi by click the wireless icon in the top right corner of the screen
* Select `Reinstall MacOS Monterey` to continue

Note: 
* You may need to wait very long time for `continue` button to show out
* You must `press the mouse pad` to simulate the left click button. Double tap doesn't work
