## Mixer
### Yamaha MG10XU
* `PFL` Button



* `PAD` Button

It'll reduce the input gain by a fixed amount (26 decibels) and helps you get a better signals. 

If something makes a really loud sound: guitar amp, symble, snare drum, kick drum, etc. 
Even if you set the level to 0 and the peak light is already blinking before you add any gain to it, 
then you need to turn the PAD on.

The `PRE` or `Pre Fade` button will toggle the default state of an Aux Send from being post-fade into being pre-fade.
