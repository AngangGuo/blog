### How to recover deleted message/folder in Outlook?
See [doc](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/recover-deleted-items-in-outlook-for-windows-49e81f3c-c8f4-4426-a0b9-c0fd751d48ce)

* You can recover the deleted messages in the `Deleted Items` folder.
* You can find the deleted folder by click the `>` mark in front of the `> Deleted Items` folder.

Then you can select the deleted message/folder and move it out.

If you can't find the deleted item in your Outlook, you can recover it from the server:
* Select the `Deleted Items` folder
* On the `Home` menu, select `Recover Deleted Items From Server`
* Select the items that you want to recover, select `Restore Selected Items`, and then select `OK`
