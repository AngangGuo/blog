Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. 

* Download Anki: apps.ankiweb.net
* Online manual: docs.ankiweb.net

## Concepts
* Card: A question and answer pair is called a 'card'.
* Deck: A 'deck' is a group of cards. Decks can contain other decks; Decks are best used to hold broad categories of cards
* Notes & Fields:
* Card Types

## Setting
### Paste clipboard images as PNG
By default Anki pastes images on the clipboard as JPG files, to save disk space. 
You can use the option to paste as PNG images instead. 
PNG images support transparent backgrounds and are lossless, but they usually result in much larger file sizes.

### Paste without Shift strips formatting
By default, formatting like bold and colors are kept when pasting, unless the Shift key is held down(Ctrl+Shift+V). 
This option reverses the behaviour(Ctrl+V paste text without formatting).

I selected this option due to most of the time I need the text only(Bible verses), not format.

### User interface size
If you find that the interface elements are too small for you, you can try to increase this setting.

### Timebox time limit
When you see hundreds of cards in the ‘due’ column, finding motivation to sit down and work all the way through can be challenging.
So, instead, set a time limit.

Timeboxing is a technique to help you focus by dividing a longer activity (such as a 60-minute study session)
into smaller blocks(20 minutes). If you set the timebox time limit to a non-zero number of minutes, 
Anki will periodically show you how many cards you’ve managed to study during the prescribed time limit.


### On next sync, force changes in one direction
When the 'force changes' option is enabled, the next sync will ask you whether you wish to upload or download. 

This is useful if you have made some changes accidentally, and wish to overwrite them with an older version that is on AnkiWeb.
