## Soundbar
### How to connect the soundbar to the subwoofer automatically?
For SAMSUNG HW-C450

When you turn the power on after connecting the power cables to the Soundbar and subwoofer, the
subwoofer is automatically connected to the Soundbar.

When auto pairing is complete, the blue indicators at the rear of the subwoofer turn on.

If the standby light is red, check if the power cable attached to the main Soundbar unit is connected properly.

If the LED indicator lights on the rear of subwoofer blinking,
check if the power cable attached to the main Soundbar unit is
connected properly or wait about 3 minutes. 

If blinking persists, try manually connecting the subwoofer. 

### How to manually connect the soundbar to the subwoofer? 
1. Press and hold ID SET on the rear of the subwoofer for at least 5 seconds.
The red indicator on the rear of the subwoofer turns off and the blue indicator blinks.

more than 5 seconds while the Soundbar is in “BT” mode and in “BT READY” state.)
