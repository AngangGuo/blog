### The brew group gear is not in neutral position
* Follow the instructions below how to set the brew group gear inside the machine in neutral position:
* Close the service door, and place everything back (water tank/ drip tray/ coffee grounds container).
* Press the ON/OFF button to switch OFF the machine. Wait until you hear no more sounds (this can take up to 15-20 seconds).
* Press the ON/OFF button to switch the machine ON. Do not take any actions as opening the service door/ removing the drip tray/water tank before the machine is ready for use.
* Open the service door and try again to remove the brew group by pressing the “PUSH” button to the right side, hold it, and pull it towards you.

### Machine in descaling mode
If your espresso machine is in descaling mode, the brew group cannot be removed. 
To solve this, finish the descaling process first and try again.
