## G+A+A: God And Andrew

### Psalm 23
1. The LORDis my shepherd; I shall not want.
2. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters.
3. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

### Numbers 6:24-26
24.	The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:
25.	The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
26.	The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

### 民数记6:24-26
愿耶和华赐福给你，保护你。愿耶和华使他的脸光照你，赐恩给你。愿耶和华向你仰脸，赐你平安。
